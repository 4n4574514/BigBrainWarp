.. **The Big Brain Warp**
   ============================
   *BigBrain is a singular dataset that offers a volumetric reconstruction of ultra-high-resolution cell-stained slices of a post mortem human brain. 
BigBrainWarp provides for approaches to multi-modal integration of BigBrain by transforming between histological to MNI152 space, towards helping a wide range of neuroscientistists utilise the cytoarchitectural information encoded in BigBrain.*

**Welcome to The Big Brain Warp**
==========================================

We aim to provide:

* Centralised information on integration of BigBrain with multi-modal imaging
* Simple modular scripts to perform nonlinear warping between spaces, that readily accomodate ongoing methodological advances
* Step-by-step examples of multi-modal integration with BigBrain
* Imaging-based maps in BigBrain space
* BigBrain-based maps in MNI152 space
