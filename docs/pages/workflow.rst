Workflow
==================

Multi-modal integration of BigBrain involves many moving parts. We aim to update modules as they become available. To start with, the general workflow between spaces follows:

Breaking this down, the most simple scripts that trasnform between BigBrain and ICBM volumetric look like so:

.. image:: ./images/bbw_workflow/Slide2.PNG
   :height: 400px
   :align: center

.. image:: ./images/bbw_workflow/Slide3.PNG
   :height: 400px
   :align: center

Or perhaps you're interested in mapping a MRI-derived gradient from fsaverage to the BigBrain surface:
