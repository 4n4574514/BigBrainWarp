Workflow
==================

Multi-modal integration of BigBrain involves many moving parts. Using extant publications and new scripts to bridge gaps, moving between the spaces follows this general schema:

Upacking this further, the most simple scripts that transform between BigBrain and ICBM volumetric would follow the paths:

   :align: center

   :height: 350px
   :align: center

In contrast, the conversion from fsaverage to the BigBrain surface, for example with an MRI-derived cortical gradient, follows the path:
