Frequently Asked Questions
====================================


**How can I build equivolumetric surfaces?** This can be performed using the `python-based surface tools <https://github.com/kwagstyl/surface_tools/tree/v1.0.0>`_, which we've also translated for `matlab-based pipelines <https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micaopen/blob/master/cortical_confluence/scripts/equivolumetric_surfaces.m>`_. You can also use `micapipe <https://micapipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to generate equivolumetric surfaces and sample microstructure profiles.
