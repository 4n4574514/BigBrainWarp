   * - Terms
     - Contextual definitions
   * - Allocortex
     - Three-layered cortex (hippocampus and piriform cortex) which exhibits peculiar characteristics prenatally and was labelled as allogenetic (Vogt 1910, Sanides 1969)
   * - Cortical confluence
     - Mergence of cortical types (iso- and allo-cortex) in the mesiotemporal lobe (Paquola et al., 2020)
   * - Cytoarchitecture
     - Organisation of cells
   * - Equivolumetric
     - Intracortical surfaces constructed in such a way that preserves the volume of each strata (Waehnert et al., 2014; Wagstyl et al., 2019)
   * - fsaverage
     - Standard surface in FreeSurfer
   * - Gradients
     - Graded spatial variations in a neurobiological feature
   * - Microstructure profile
     - A sequence of intracortical intensity values (staining or MRI) running from the pial to white matter, ie: in the direction of cortical column (Paquola et al., 2019)
   * - Moments
     - Quantitative measures related to the shape of a microstructure profile
   * - Parcellated
     - aggregation (usually averaging) of a neurobiological feature within a pre-defined cortical area
   * - Sensory-fugal
     - A functional characterisation of the cortical gradient that runs from externally-focused primary sensory areas to transmodal, limbic areas that are relatively decoupled from environmental input (Mesulam 2000)
