Cortical confluence         Mergence of cortical types (iso and allo) in the mesiotemporal lobe
Cytoarchitecture            Vertical arrangement of cells in the cortex
Equivolumetric              Intracortical surfaces constructed with equivalent volumes in each layer
fsaverage                   Standard surface in FreeSurfer
Gradients                   Gradual spatial variations in a neurobiological feature
Microstructure profile      Depth-wise intensities
MNI152                      Standard imaging space, another name for ICBM152
Moments                     quantitative measures related to the shape of a microstructure profile
Parcellated                 collating (usually averaging) of a neurobiological feature within an area
Sensory-fugal               A functional characterisation of the cortical gradient that runs from externally-focused primary sensory areas to transmodal, limbic areas that are relatively decoupled from environmental input (Mesulam 2000)
