Getting Started
==================

* Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine (https://github.com/caseypaquola/BigBrainWarp.git)
* Edit the BigBrainWarp/scripts/init.sh file based on the specific paths of your machine
* Prior to running any scripts, run <source init.sh> to set the necessary global environment variables


Dependencies
**************

We've included some small dependencies in the GitHub repository. In addition, 

* All transformations require MINC2 (http://bic-mni.github.io/) and FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki)
* Surface-based transformations require the CBIG GitHub repository (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG) and MATLAB (tested on 19b, https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
