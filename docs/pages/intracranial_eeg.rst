Mapping an atlas of intracranial EEG to BigBrain space
======================================================

Normal physiological activity of neuronal populations have been recorded with stereo-EEG electrodes and cortical grids/strips, and collated across 106 subjects to construct a atlaas of intracranial EEG with 1785 channels (Frauscher et al., 2018). The electrode traces and their positions (co-registered to MNI152) are provided as an open web resource (https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca). Here, we aim to adjust the coordinates of the electrodes to BigBrain space to facilitate complementary histological analyses.
