**Welcome to The Big Brain Warp**
==========================================

Integrating BigBrain with multi-modal imaging 
----------------------------------------------------
BigBrain is a singular dataset that offers a volumetric reconstruction of ultra-high-resolution cell-stained slices of a post mortem human brain. BigBrainWarp provides for approaches to multi-modal integration of BigBrain by transforming between histological to MNI152 space, towards helping a wide range of neuroscientistists utilise the cytoarchitectural information encoded in BigBrain. The enclosed scripts will help transform between various spaces and extract pertinent information from BigBrain.

Step-by-step tutorials
------------------------------------
Using these scripts, we'll demonstrate how to perform multi-modal integration of BigBrain for a range of scenarios.

Spatial maps
-----------------
We've also generated spatial maps of some interesting measures and performed the transformations. That means pre-computed BigBrain maps in imaging space and imaging-based maps in BigBrain space ready for download.
