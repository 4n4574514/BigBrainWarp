The Big Brain Warp
================================================================================

*BigBrain is singular dataset that offers a volumetric reconstruction of high-resolution 
cell-stained slices of a post mortem human brain. BigBrainWarp provides approaches to 
transform from histological to MNI152 space to help a wide range of neuroscientistists 
utilise the cytoarchitectural information encoded in BigBrain.*

We aim to provide:

* Centralised information on integration of BigBrain with multi-modal imaging
* Simple modular scripts to perform nonlinear warping between spaces, that readily accomodate ongoing methodological advances
* Imaging-based maps in BigBrain space
* BigBrain-based maps in MNI152 space
