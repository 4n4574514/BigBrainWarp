**Welcome to BIG BRAIN WARP**
==========================================

Integrating BigBrain with multi-modal imaging 
----------------------------------------------------
BigBrain is a singular dataset that offers an ultra-high-resolution (20Âµm) volumetric reconstruction of a sliced and stained post mortem human brain. BigBrainWarp aims to enable multi-modal integration of BigBrain, helping a wide range of neuroscientists to utilise the cytoarchitectural information encoded in BigBrain.

In the toolbox, youâ€™ll find preprocessed BigBrain data, scripts to transform between BigBrain and standard MRI spaces, and a selection of maps already transformed across surfaces. 

Additionally, weâ€™ve created a series of tutorials that illustrate potential workflows for BigBrain-MRI integration.

ðŸš§ The toolbox and readthedocs are still under construction. If you're interested in certain features or data, please get in touch and we can let you know whether it's finalised and provide the most up to date version.
