**Welcome to The Big Brain Warp**
==========================================

Integrating BigBrain with multi-modal imaging 
----------------------------------------------------
BigBrain is a singular dataset that offers a volumetric reconstruction of ultra-high-resolution cell-stained slices of a post mortem human brain. BigBrainWarp provides for approaches to multi-modal integration of BigBrain by transforming between histological to MNI152 space, towards helping a wide range of neuroscientistists utilise the cytoarchitectural information encoded in BigBrain. The enclosed scripts will help transform between various spaces and extract pertinent information from BigBrain.
Using these scripts, we'll demonstrate how to perform multi-modal integration of BigBrain for a range of scenarios.
We've also generated spatial maps of some interesting measures and performed the transformations. That means pre-computed BigBrain maps in imaging space and imaging-based maps in BigBrain space ready for download.
