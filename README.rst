BigBrainWarp
====================

This repository provides tools and resources for multimodal integration with `Big Brain <https://bigbrain.loris.ca/main.php>`_, 
leveraging state-of-the-art co-registration methods and openly available datasets for in vivo structural and functional MRI, gene expression, receptor mapping, polarized light imaging, and intracranial electroencephalography.

BigBrain is a singular dataset that offers a volumetric reconstruction of high-resolution cell-stained slices of a post mortem human brain.
With BigBrainWarp, we aim provide to provide a centralised repository of resources and code to maximise the utility of BigBrain.
* Centralised information on integration of BigBrain with multi-modal imaging
* Simple scripts to perform nonlinear warping between spaces
* Imaging-based maps in BigBrain space
* BigBrain-based maps in MNI152 space


Support
